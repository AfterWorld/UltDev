                f"Yohohoho! {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {'has' if len(success_list) == 1 else 'have'} been silenced like Brook without his voice box {time_str}! The sudden silence caused Brook to panic and play his guitar at max volume, shattering all the mirrors in the Whole Cake Chateau. Now Big Mom can't admire her new hairdo, Brulee's mirror world is in chaos, and somehow, Absalom's invisibility has stopped working.",
                
                f"Great Scott! {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {'has' if len(success_list) == 1 else 'have'} been sent to the Calm Belt of chat {time_str}! Not even a Den Den Mushi can reach {'them' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'them'}. The resulting silence has lulled all the Sea Kings to sleep, causing a massive traffic jam of Marine ships. Garp is now giving a loud lecture on justice, ironically waking up the Sea Kings and causing general pandemonium.",
                
                f"Holy Merry! {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {'has' if len(success_list) == 1 else 'have'} been caught in Foxy's Noro Noro Beam {time_str}! {'Their' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'Their'} messages will be slowed to a crawl. The beam reflected off Franky's super shiny robot body, accidentally slowing down Aokiji's ice powers. Now Punk Hazard is slowly defrosting, Caeser Clown's experiments are melting, and Trafalgar Law is wondering why his 'Room' is expanding at a snail's pace.",
                
                f"Gomu Gomu no Silence! {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {'has' if len(success_list) == 1 else 'have'} had {'their' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'their'} chat privileges stretched to the limit {time_str}! Luffy's arms got tangled in the process, turning him into a giant rubber band. Now Usopp's using him as a slingshot to launch Chopper across the Grand Line for emergency medical house calls, while Zoro's trying to cut Luffy free but keeps getting lost between his stretched fingers.",
                
                f"Mamamama! Big Mom has stolen the voice of {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} and put it in her collection {time_str}! She's using it as a ringtone for her Den Den Mushi. The new ringtone is so catchy that all of Totto Land is dancing uncontrollably. Katakuri's trying to predict the next beat, Pudding's memory-wiping everyone who saw her trip during her dance solo, and Streusen's accidentally baked a ten-layer cake in rhythm.",
                
                f"Zoro got lost again and accidentally led {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} into the Void Century {time_str}! Good luck finding your way back... maybe ask someone with a better sense of direction? Like a potato. The World Government is in panic mode, Imu is furiously scribbling 'DO NOT ENTER' signs, and the Five Elders are seriously considering hiring Zoro as their new security system. Meanwhile, Robin's having a field day deciphering the Poneglyphs Zoro accidentally uncovered.",
                
                f"Sanji's Diable Jambe was too hot! It burned {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s keyboard to a crisp {time_str}! On the bright side, their computer setup is now 'toast'... literally. The fire spread to Nami's tangerine grove, but instead of burning, it caramelized all the fruits. Now Luffy won't stop eating them, Chopper's panicking about potential sugar rush, and Sanji's creating a new recipe for 'Flamb√©ed Tangerine Love Hurricane' in honor of his beloved Nami-swan.",
                
                f"Crocodile's sand has dried up the ink in {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s pen {time_str}. No more writing for you! Time to communicate via interpretive dance. The sand storm has spread across the Grand Line, turning every island into a beach paradise. Buggy's sandals got stuck, his feet detached, and now his crew is chasing them across the New World. Meanwhile, Aokiji's building the world's largest sand castle and Blackbeard's complaining about sand in his beard.",
                
                f"Usopp's latest invention, the 'Shut-Up-A-Pirate 3000', worked perfectly on {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {time_str}! The shock of his success caused Usopp to faint, accidentally launching a Pop Green that grew into a beanstalk reaching Skypiea. Now Enel's trying to slide down it back to Earth, Nami's calculating the profit from a sky-high toll booth, and God Usopp's follower count just broke the Internet.",
                
                f"Chopper's Rumble Ball had an odd effect on {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}. {'They' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'They'} can't type {time_str}! Instead, {'they`re' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'they`re'} stuck making adorable reindeer noises. The cuteness overload caused Bartholomew Kuma to malfunction, shooting Pacifistas filled with cotton candy across the Grand Line. Now Perona's negative hollows are turning suspiciously positive, Moria's zombies are having a sugar-fueled dance party, and Doflamingo's strings have turned into licorice whips.",
                
                f"Robin sprouted hands all over {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s keyboard, preventing {'them' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'them'} from typing {time_str}! Now their keyboard just keeps typing 'hand hand hand hand'. The hands have taken over the ship, forming a giant mecha that's now challenging Queen's dinosaur form to a robot dance-off. Franky's taking notes for his next super upgrade, while Brook's providing the soundtrack with his new hit single, 'Hands Up for Adventure'.",
                
                f"Franky performed a SUPER mute on {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {time_str}! Cola-powered silence! Side effects may include spontaneous posing and an irresistible urge to yell 'SUPER!' The excess cola fumes have turned all the fish in the area into hyperactive disco dancers. Now Jinbe's trying to coral them into formation for an underwater musical, Sanji's inventing new recipes for 'Jitterbug Jellyfish Jambalaya', and the Kraken's become a master of the Swim Swim fruit... dance, that is.",
                
                f"Jinbei's Fish-Man Karate sent {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} flying into the Void Century {time_str}! They`re now best friends with Joy Boy, apparently. The shockwave from his karate chop traveled through time, giving Toki's time-time fruit a hiccup. Now Momonosuke is randomly shifting between baby and adult dragon forms, the Nine Red Scabbards are trying to childproof Wano for their time-jumping lord, and Kaido is very confused about why his intimidating roars keep turning into baby dragon squeaks.",
                
                f"Nami's Thunder Tempo has short-circuited {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s communication devices {time_str}! The resulting power surge overcharged Franky's hair, causing a worldwide shortage of cola. This led to Luffy raiding Chopper's cotton candy supply, Sanji stress-baking until he filled Whole Cake Island with cream puffs, and Pudding having to erase everyone's memories of ever liking cola. Meanwhile, Zoro's somehow gotten lost in Nami's electric currents and ended up in the One Piece live-action set.",
                
                f"Buggy's Chop-Chop Fruit accidentally divided {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s messages into tiny, unreadable pieces {time_str}! We're still trying to put them back together, but some parts seem to have floated away. In the chaos, Buggy's nose landed on Usopp's face, giving him unprecedented lying powers. His tall tales are now coming true, causing Marines to believe in the existence of a giant gold-pooping beetle. Garp is leading an expedition to find it, much to Sengoku's frustration.",
                
                f"Trafalgar Law's ROOM has temporarily removed {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s ability to communicate {time_str}! He's replaced it with the ability to make really bad puns. Heart-breaking, isn't it? The puns are so bad They`re causing physical pain, making Chopper rush around trying to cure this new 'disease'. Bepo's actually loving it, much to the horror of the Heart Pirates. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown is trying to weaponize the puns for his next evil scheme.",
                
                f"Blackbeard's Dark-Dark Fruit has swallowed {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s messages into a void {time_str}! Rumor has it, you can still hear the echoes if you listen closely to a black hole. The void started sucking in everything dark, including Zoro's dark aura when he gets lost. Now Zoro's stuck orbiting Blackbeard, using his swords as oars, while Perona's negative hollows are getting a tan from the darkness absorption. Van Augur's having the time of his life using the void as a portal for trick shots across the Grand Line.",
                
                f"Doflamingo's strings have tied up {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s fingers, preventing {'them' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'them'} from typing {time_str}! On the bright side, {'they`ve' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'they`ve'} never looked more fabulous in pink feathers. The excess string has turned Dressrosa into a giant cat's cradle. King is stuck thinking it's some kind of advanced interrogation technique, Charlotte Smoothie is trying to juice the strings for a new cocktail, and Leo of the Tontatta Tribe is having a field day with his new sewing materials.",
                
                f"Gecko Moria's shadows have stolen {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s ability to chat {time_str}! Now their shadows are having a great conversation without them. The shadowless users have teamed up with Brook to form the world's first transparent band. Their music is so soul-stirring it's causing Moria's zombie army to break out in a thriller dance. Perona's ghosts are working as special effects, and Absalom's reporting on it while invisible, leading to floating cameras all over Thriller Bark.",
                
                f"Aokiji's Ice Age has frozen {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s keyboard solid {time_str}! Might we suggest defrosting it with Ace's Flame-Flame Fruit? ...Oh, too soon? The sudden cold snap has turned all of Water 7 into a giant ice rink. Franky's redesigning the Sea Train with ice skates, Kokoro's Mermaid Cafe is now an igloo, and the Galley-La shipwrights are carving galleons out of ice. Meanwhile, Aokiji's been mistaken for a very lazy ice sculptor and entered into Iceburg's winter festival competition.",
                
                f"Kizaru moved at the speed of light and unplugged {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s internet connection {time_str}! He would plug it back in, but that sounds like a lot of work. In his haste, Kizaru accidentally caused a worldwide blackout. Now Enel's moonlight is the only source of electricity, making him feel like a god again. Rayleigh's haki training has turned into 'catch the light beams', and Sentomaru's so fed up he's considering leaving the Marines to become a candlemaker.",
                
                f"Kaido's Blast Breath melted {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s chat privileges {time_str}! We'd offer them a new keyboard, but Kaido drank all the money we were going to use to buy it. The heat from Kaido's breath turned Wano into a sauna. Queen's now running a luxury spa for Beasts Pirates, King's flame powers are being used to keep the towels warm, and Jack's stuck as the pool boy. Meanwhile, Yamato's hosting snowball fights with her ice powers to help everyone cool down.",
                
                f"Marco the Phoenix's blue flames have temporarily incinerated {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s chat access {time_str}! Don't worry, it'll regenerate... eventually. The blue flames spread across the Moby Dick, turning it into a ghost ship. Now Whitebeard's mustache is glowing blue, Jozu's diamond form is refracting the light into a disco ball effect, and Thatch is cooking with eternal fire. Vista's rose petals have turned into blue fire butterflies, creating the world's most dangerous garden.",
                
                f"Ivankov's hormones have mysteriously changed {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s voice, making it impossible to type {time_str}! {'They`re' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'They`re'} now communicating exclusively in fabulous winks. The hormone burst has affected all of Kamabakka Kingdom. Sanji's okama disguise is now permanent, Mr. 2 Bon Clay is stuck in a never-ending series of face changes, and somehow, Crocodile is blushing. The Revolutionary Army isn't sure whether to be amused or very, very concerned.",
                
                f"Bartolomeo's Barrier Fruit has cut off {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} from the chat {time_str}! He says he'll take it down if you can get him Luffy's autograph. The barrier expanded to cover all of Dressrosa, turning it into a giant bounce house. Cavendish is using it as a beauty sleep chamber, Rebecca's Colosseum fights have turned into sumo matches, and King Riku is seriously considering this as a permanent national defense system. Meanwhile, Pica's voice is echoing hilariously off the barrier walls.",
                
                f"Enel's lightning struck {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s computer, causing a temporary blackout {time_str}! Their new electric personality is quite shocking. The lightning overcharged the Ark Maxim, sending it crashing back to the Blue Sea. Now Enel's stuck running a tech support hotline for Den Den Mushi, the Skypieans are trying to explain clouds to very confused fish, and Wiper's trying to conquer the ocean with his Burn Bazooka, creating the world's largest jacuzzi.",
                
                f"Garp threw his Fist of Love, knocking {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} out of the chat {time_str}! That's what we call 'tough love'... emphasis on the 'tough'. The shockwave from Garp's fist circled the globe, giving everyone a momentary sense of Marine-induced guilt. Sengoku's goat ate the resulting wave of paper apologies, turning it into a Zoan-type 'Guilt-Guilt Fruit' user. Now the goat's making even Akainu question his life choices, Luffy's actually considering becoming a Marine, and Coby's promotion to Admiral is being fast-tracked.",
            
                f"Mihawk's sword slash was so precise, it cut {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s chat connection {time_str}! He was aiming for a fly, but you know how it goes. The slash continued across the Grand Line, accidentally giving everyone perfect haircuts. Buggy's nose hair got trimmed, allowing him to smell the One Piece. Now the Red-Haired Pirates and the Buggy Pirates are in a sniffing race, Zoro's swords are demanding a style upgrade, and Sanji's somehow gotten his eyebrow un-curled.",
            
                f"Magellan's Venom Demon has poisoned {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s chatting ability {time_str}! Side effects include an extreme case of verbal diarrhea... ironically. The poison seeped into Impel Down's plumbing, turning the underwater forest into a psychedelic wonderland. Now Hannyabal's impersonating Magellan but with tie-dye skin, Sadi-chan's whip is spouting motivational quotes, and Ivankov's declaring it the new paradise of 'free self-expression'. The World Government is not amused.",
            
                f"Perona's Negative Hollow made {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} too depressed to type {time_str}! {'They`re' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'They`re'} currently under their desk, mumbling about being reborn as a lint roller. The negativity spread across Thriller Bark, making even the zombies too depressed to fight. Gecko Moria's now running a support group for 'Shadows with Low Self-Esteem', Absalom's invisible tears are causing mysterious indoor rain, and Kumacy's finally expressing his true feelings through nihilistic poetry.",
            
                f"Caesar Clown's Gastinet made the air around {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} unbreathable, forcing {'them' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'them'} to retreat from chat {time_str}! Their last message was just a series of coughs and 'SHURORORORO'. The gas expanded, turning Punk Hazard into a giant bouncy castle. Now Trafalgar Law's 'Room' is full of giggling Straw Hats, Smoker's smoke is coming out in balloon animals, and Vegapunk's long-distance Den Den Mushi are transmitting nothing but laugh tracks.",
            
                f"Fujitora's gravity crushed {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s keyboard {time_str}, making typing impossible! They`re now communicating via interpretive meteor showers. The altered gravity caused Zunisha to start moonwalking across the New World. Now Jack's seasick, the Mink Tribe is hosting anti-gravity raves, and Raizo's ninja scrolls keep floating away. Meanwhile, Fujitora's trying to convince everyone it's a new form of 'Celestial Navigation'.",
            
                f"Sengoku's Buddha shockwave sent {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} flying out of the chat room {time_str}! We expect {'them' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'them'} to achieve enlightenment any day now. The shockwave resonated with all the gold in Mary Geoise, turning the Holy Land into a giant tuning fork. Now Imu's trying to conduct the world's largest celestial orchestra, the Gorosei are vibrating in perfect harmony, and Charlos's bubble helmet has become a floating sound booth. Donquixote Mjosgard is surprisingly into it.",
            
                f"Borsalino's light speed kick launched {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} into a communication dead zone {time_str}! He would've brought {'them' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'them'} back, but that sounds like eeeeffort~. The kick tore a hole in the space-time continuum, causing past and future versions of pirates to appear randomly. Now Luffy's getting meat-eating tips from his future self, Blackbeard's trying to steal devil fruits from his past self, and Buggy's past and future selves are forming an endless circus line.",
            
                f"Bonney's Age-Age Fruit regressed {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} to an age before they could type {time_str}! {'They`re' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'They`re'} currently teething on the keyboard. The age regression spread across Sabaody, turning it into a giant daycare. Rayleigh's teaching Haki to toddlers, Shakky's bar is now serving juice boxes, and the Human Auction House is hosting nap time. Kid Doflamingo is having a tantrum because his sunglasses don't fit, while baby Kuma is crawling around with a miniature Bible.",
            
                f"Queen's Plague Rounds infected {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s chat privileges with silence {time_str}! The only cure is to dance like no one's watching... because They`re not. They can't see you. The virus mutated, turning everyone in Wano into funk soul brothers. Now Kaido's Beast Pirates are having a dance-off against the Nine Red Scabbards, Orochi's hair snakes are doing the conga, and Yamato's ice powers are being used to create a giant disco ball. Kin'emon's clothes are changing faster than John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.",
            
                f"Shirahoshi accidentally called a Sea King, who ate {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s messages {time_str}! The Sea King is now the most well-informed creature in the ocean. Poseidon's powers went into overdrive, summoning all the Sea Kings to Fishman Island for a ted talk. Now Hody Jones is the reluctant audio-visual guy, Vander Decken IX is trying to throw love letters at the Sea King's non-existent hands, and Neptune's turned the whole thing into a music festival called 'Sea-chella'.",
            
                f"Corazon's Silent-Silent Fruit failed spectacularly, causing him to trip and unplug {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s computer(s) {time_str}! As he silently screamed, he accidentally knocked over Vegapunk's latest experiment. The resulting explosion turned all Den Den Mushi into break-dancing snails, leaving the Marines to communicate via interpretative dance. Somewhere in the New World, Doflamingo is laughing so hard he's tangled in his own strings.",
            
                f"Hody Jones' Energy Steroids caused {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} to rage-quit the chat {time_str}! {'They' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'They'} punched through their monitor in a fit of steroid-induced fury. The steroids seeped into the ocean, turning all the fish into bodybuilders. Now Jinbe's teaching an underwater aerobics class, Arlong Park has been converted into a protein shake bar, and Sanji's having a existential crisis over how to delicately prepare a fish with biceps.",
            
                f"Kuma's Paw-Paw Fruit has deflected all of {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s messages {time_str}! {'They`re' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'They`re'} expected to land somewhere in the chat... in about 3 days. The deflected messages gained sentience during their flight, forming a new Sky Island made entirely of floating text. Now Urouge's trying to decipher the wisdom of the chat gods, Enel's planning to conquer it with his 'divine grammar', and Nami's calculating the profit margins on selling punctuation to the locals.",
            
                f"Capone Bege trapped {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} inside his body fortress, cutting off their communication {time_str}! They`re currently lost somewhere between his pancreas and his spleen. Bege's body has turned into a funhouse of rooms, each themed after a different pirate crew. Now Big Mom's rampaging through his sweet tooth, Kaido's trying to turn his liver into Onigashima, and somehow Luffy's found the meat storage. Bege's really regretting skipping those anatomy classes.",
            
                f"Hawkins' Straw-Straw Fruit has predicted a period of silence for {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {time_str}! The cards also predict they'll stub their toe later. Ouch. The prediction caused a butterfly effect of self-fulfilling prophecies across the New World. Now Kaido's avoiding high places, Big Mom's on a diet, and Blackbeard's desperately trying to return his overdue library books. Meanwhile, Basil Hawkins has become a reluctant relationship counselor, with his cards deciding the fate of pirate ship crushes everywhere.",
            
                f"Pudding's Memory-Memory Fruit made {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} forget how to type {time_str}! They`re currently trying to send messages by aggressively poking their screen. The memory loss spread like wildfire through Totto Land. Now Katakuri can't remember how to see the future, Big Mom's forgotten her food cravings, and the Chess Peacekeepers are stuck in an eternal stalemate. Sanji's teaching everyone how to cook, inadvertently turning Whole Cake Island into the Grand Line's largest culinary school.",
            
                f"Tama's Kibi-Kibi Fruit accidentally tamed {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s keyboard, and now it won't work for anyone else {time_str}! The keyboard now only types in happy animal noises. The dango's effect spread to all technology in Wano, turning Den Den Mushi into loyal pets. Now Queen's cybernetics keep trying to fetch his bombs, Franky's hair is purring contentedly, and poor Apoo can't stop his body from playing 'Who Let the Dogs Out'. Meanwhile, Kaido's drunk-dialing other Yonko with nothing but 'moo's and 'baa's.",
            
                f"Smoker's Smoke-Smoke Fruit has obscured {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s messages {time_str}! Their chat window now looks like a very unsuccessful attempt at vaping. The smoke spread across Marineford, turning it into a foggy murder mystery dinner party. Now Akainu's trying to solve 'The Case of the Missing Justice', Kizaru's bumping into walls at the speed of light, and Coby's been mistaken for the butler and forced to serve tea. Garp's just napping through the whole thing, occasionally sleep-punching culprits.",
            
                f"X Drake transformed into a dinosaur and accidentally stomped on {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s communication device {time_str}! In his defense, those tiny keyboards are hard to use with giant dino claws. The soundwave from the stomp resonated with all the Zoan Devil Fruit users, turning Onigashima into a prehistoric party. Now Page One and Ulti are having a head-butting contest, Queen's funk has evolved into dinosaur disco, and poor Jack is stuck as a mammoth in a china shop. Meanwhile, Kaido's dragon form is trying to organize everyone into 'Jurassic Park' style Thriller choreography.",
            
                f"Carrot's Sulong form was too bright, temporarily blinding {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} {time_str}! They`re now typing in all caps because they can't see the keyboard properly. The Sulong transformation spread to all the minks, turning Zou into a giant lighthouse. Now Jack's ship keeps crashing into Zunisha's legs, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi have forgotten their day/night feud and are hosting 24/7 raves, and Bepo's luminous fur has turned the Heart Pirates' submarine into a mobile disco ball.",
            
                f"Giolla's Art-Art Fruit turned {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s messages into abstract art, making them unreadable {time_str}! Critics are calling it 'a bold statement on the futility of communication'. The artistic effect spread across Dressrosa, turning the whole island into a living Picasso painting. Now Pica's voice is coming out in color splatters, Diamante's cape is rearranging itself into cubist forms, and Sugar's toys are all walking around like Dali's melting clocks. King Riku is seriously considering rebranding the country as 'Dressrosa Modern Art Museum'.",
            
                f"Kinemon's disguise for {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])} was so perfect, nobody could recognize {'them' if len(success_list) > 1 else 'them'} in the chat {time_str}! They`re currently pretending to be a very talkative house plant. Kinemon's power glitched, causing everyone in Wano to swap appearances. Now Kaido looks like O-Tama, Big Mom is stuck in Toko's body, and Orochi keeps shapeshifting between his many heads. The Straw Hats' rescue mission has turned into a ridiculous game of Guess Who, with Luffy enjoying it way too much.",
            
                f"Boa Hancock's Love-Love Fruit turned {humanize_list([f'`{u}`' for u in success_list])}'s keyboard to stone {time_str}! Now that's what we call 'hard' feelings! The petrification spread through the internet, turning all online communication into an ancient form of stone tablets. Now the Revolutionary Army is trying to organize a coup via stone emoji, the Marines are chiseling wanted posters instead of printing them, and poor Morgans is struggling to delivery the 'Daily Stone' newspaper. Meanwhile, Sentomaru's Den Den Mushi has become a very confused garden gnome."
